every asset loads all the textures used upon initialization
every asset holds a textureCount variable
every instance has a currentTexture variable which must be <= textureCount
the reason I use the term currentTexture instead of state is because the state of an object does not necessarily equte to the animation frame necessary.
	(eg. falling state, but a separate "texture" (kinda-ish) for left side and right side in a 2D system. (bad example, I know, but you get the point)).

it is ok to keep ModelAsset and ModelInstance, because those are the correct solution for rigid body physics
"Class Name" will be made later on by me in order to account for soft body physics.
A "Class Name" will effectively be a ModelAsset and a Model Instance combined, before any changes are applied.
Possible class name: Entity
